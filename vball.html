                    This section will be showcasing my love for volleyball.
                    Despite how short I am, I really enjoyed playing volleyball. Its competitiveness
                    how the foundations can go really far, how both physically and mentally taxing it can 
                    be. There are just so many things about the sport that, in a way, takes off stress
                    from responsibilities and real life in general.  
                </p>

                <p class="description">
                    Through volleyball, I learned many skills that not only can be used in the sport obviously,
                    but as well as real life skills. Skills like leadership, confidence, persistence, too many to name, 
                    were all improved and gained through volleyball. Of course there are the sport-specific skills
                    like agility, athleticsm, that I had to train in order to get even close to average. Being small, 
                    led to a brief imposter syndrome, as I've always dreamed to be an outside hitter but the coaches thought
                    otherwise. I didn't want to be forced to play libero, although I did for one season, so I honed my
                    skills in order to be a setter and as well as my jumping ability so that I would still be able to press
                    my hands over the net.

                    This is a picture of my Junior Varsity Team winning 3rd place in zones. 
                    We could have won first but ended up doing really bad against quarter finals,
                    which we won against all season. Nonetheless, we were still happy for winning a medal.
