                        Through the process of this website, it made me learn the basic use of html
                        and css. With videos from youtube and the lessons provided in class, while it
                        may not have been the best looking, I learned concepts like flexbox, tables, forms, etc.
                        I have not learned responsiveness yet so the website in different viewports were very
                        scuffed.
                        And yes the work was very rushed and could have been more refined but I procrastinated heavily
                        which
                        forced me to rush the work and in the end handing it in past the due date.

                    In Assignment 2, we learned much more concepts like responsiveness of a website,
                    more indepth on grid and flexbox. While I was experimenting with the responsiveness
                    I had a lot of trouble of successfully making it fully responsive. In the second image,
                    it shows how the images are stretched unnaturally because I was forcing it to fit in the
                    container. <br>


                    This assignment, I took a different route and instead of
                    building upon the first website, I decided to scrap the idea and create a completely different
                    topic. I go to the gym a lot and have been exposed to a couple interesting influencers which
                    then inspired me to make the website based on them.

                    As you may or may not remember, I took 1502 with you for the first time
                    and ended up dropping it because of my horrible habits. I would not study,
                    pay attention, not even show up to lectures and expected to do good in it. Whenever
                    I hit a wall in my coding process I wouldn't struggle through it and instead always 
                    try and search for a solution in the internet or use my friends for information. This made it
                    so that there were concepts I tried to use that I didn't fully understand and would ultimately
                    not flow well with my own code.

                        This is my group and I's last assignment, it's the use of GUI and to 
                        implement it to our already existing project. I did survive this semester, which 
                        I couldn't do alone, my group members not only help me grow but did contribute
                        to the assignments, lessening my workload. <br>

                        While I am proud of our code, I wish I could've linked the github for you to see, 
                        due to it being a private repo the link wouldn't work.
